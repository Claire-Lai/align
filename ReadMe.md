## Key Features

### Personalization
We understand that people care about different causes and seek to make a difference in different areas. With this in mind, we sought to provide a platform where Seekers can create and edit their profiles according to what you are looking for and what they want to showcase.

### Job Board
Our interactive job board enables users view information on roles/opportunities they may be interested in, with an option to view more about the company as well. We ensure that users can visibly see whether or not a company has been vetted and connect with Finders in peace.
### Connection

We successfully implemented a connect feature. Bringing a wrap to the core features we aimed to implement.
Now, Seekers (those who are looking to make a difference) can choose to connect with Finder (those who have found ways to make a difference and are open to collaborators). This feature provides a view wherein the Finder can view seekers who have sought to connect and the Seeker's name becomes a direct link to the Seeker's profile
### Authentication/Security
A key feature in building trust is to ensure that Finder's and Seeker's data is secured. Providing multiple Oauth options, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, Seekers are afforded secure ways to create a profile and join our platform.

Furthermore, passwords are effectively hashed with a salt element, ensuring that even in the case of a data breach, their passwords remain secure

The use of Knex ensures that Align is protected from threats like SQL injections.
