She was very thin when she came to HKDR but with good food sheâ€™s quickly gaining weight and strength. Despite her big size sheâ€™s very easy on the leash in general, and while she can sometimes react to other dogs on walks she can easily be distracted as sheâ€™s very food motivated. Please give this adorable girl a forever home! Please complete the Adoption Questionnaire as first step if you are interested in adopting Adrienne: https://hongkongdogrescue.com/adopt/adoption-questionnaire/",
